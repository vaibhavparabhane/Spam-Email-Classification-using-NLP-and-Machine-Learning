# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
# Introduction
Spam emails are unsolicited messages that clutter inboxes and may pose security risks. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to build a classifier that effectively distinguishes between spam and legitimate emails, thereby improving email management and security.
# Features
- Preprocesses email text data for analysis.
- Extracts relevant features using techniques like TF-IDF.
- Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection.
- Evaluates model performance using various metrics.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for classifying new emails.
# Model Training
The model is trained using the following steps:

1) Data Preprocessing:

-Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
-Clean and tokenize text data.
-Convert text to numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

2)Model Selection:

-Utilize algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification.

3) Training:

-Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
-Train the model on the training data.
