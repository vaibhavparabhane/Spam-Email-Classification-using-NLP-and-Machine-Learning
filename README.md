# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
# Introduction
Spam emails are unsolicited messages that clutter inboxes and may pose security risks. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to build a classifier that effectively distinguishes between spam and legitimate emails, thereby improving email management and security.
# Features
- Preprocesses email text data for analysis.
- Extracts relevant features using techniques like TF-IDF.
- Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection.
- Evaluates model performance using various metrics.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for classifying new emails.
# Dataset
  The model is trained and evaluated on the SpamAssassin Public Corpus, which contains a collection of labeled spam and ham emails.

# Model Training
The model is trained using the following steps:

1) Data Preprocessing:

      -Remove duplicates and handle missing values.

      -Clean and tokenize text data.

      -Convert text to numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

2) Model Selection:

      -Utilize algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification.

3) Training:

     -Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    
    -Train the model on the training data.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize the classification results.

# Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset, indicating high effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham emails.
